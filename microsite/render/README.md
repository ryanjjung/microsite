# Renderer

A `microsite.render.RenderEngine` provides a common way for us to parse over a set of file paths and do different things
with them.


## Markdown Renderer

A `microsite.render.eng_markdown.MarkdownRenderEngine` looks for Markdown files and renders them into HTML files using a
specified template and stylesheet.
