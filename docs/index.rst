Microsite Documentation
=======================

Microsite is a collection of tools and documentation intended to help inexperienced users develop
web content and publish it on the Internet. It includes an extensible rendering engine which
converts simple Markdown content into fully realized and styled web pages, allowing users to
separate the creative task of content creation from the technical task of managing a website. It
also includes an extensible publishing engine which allows for different forms of content hosting
online.
