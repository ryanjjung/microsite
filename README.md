Tools for building a small web.


## The "Small Web"

The Internet has morphed over the years into a more conglomerated form where most content is centralized in and filtered through the algorithms of social media platforms. These platforms restrict the personal expression of the people who create online content by applying uniform style, forcing content into particular forms, and controlling the programs that determine what content gets delivered to us. We used to be more free online than this; we used to create web rings between human-written sites designed by real people about their actual interests.

Folks who've grown tired of this corporate reshaping of our minds are beginning to align around a new form of this old concept. We call it the "small web". That is, web content created by real human beings outside mainstream platforms. This is a hand-crafted, bespoke web, a web we can explore rather than one which is imposed upon us.


## Accessibility

Learning how to make and host your own web content can be challenging and time-consuming. Software developers and engineers may not have too much trouble here, but the web is for everyone, not just computer whizzes. The tools in this project aim to make the small web more accessible to regular folks with something to say.
